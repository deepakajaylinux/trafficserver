"This is a plugin for Apache Traffic Server that allows you to proactively "
"fetch content from Origin in a way that it will fill the object into cache. "
"This is particularly useful when all (or most) of your client requests are "
"of the byte-Range type. The underlying problem being that Traffic Server is "
"not able to cache request / responses with byte ranges."

"Once deemed a good candidate to performance a background fetch, we'll "
"replay the original client request through the Traffic Server proxy again, "
