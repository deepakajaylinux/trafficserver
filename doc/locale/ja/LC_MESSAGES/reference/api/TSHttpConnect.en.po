"The :c:type:`TSVConn` the plugin receives as the result of successful "
"operates identically to one created through :c:type:`TSNetConnect`. Aside "
"from allowing the plugin to set the client ip and port for logging, the "
"functionality of :c:func:`TSHttpConnect` is identical to connecting to "
"localhost on the proxy port with :c:func:`TSNetConnect`. :c:func:"
"`TSHttpConnect` is more efficient than :c:func:`TSNetConnect` to localhost "
"since it avoids the overhead of passing the data through the operating "
"system."
