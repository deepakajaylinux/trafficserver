"If the object can be read, the Traffic Server cache calls the continuation "
"contp back with the event :c:data:`TS_EVENT_CACHE_OPEN_READ`.  In this "
"case, the cache also passes contp a cache vconnection and contp can then "
"initiate a read operation on that vconnection using :c:type:`TSVConnRead`."

"If the object cannot be read, the cache calls contp back with the event :c:"
"data:`TS_EVENT_CACHE_OPEN_READ_FAILED`.  The user (contp) has the option to "

"calls are possible, i.e. the cache can call back the user (contp) in the "
"same call."
