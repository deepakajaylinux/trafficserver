":func:`TSHttpTxnServerIntercept` allows a plugin take over the servicing of "
"the request as though it was the origin server. In the event a request "
"needs to be made to the server for transaction :arg:`txnp`, :arg:`contp` "
"will be sent a :data:`TS_EVENT_NET_ACCEPT` event. The :arg:`edata` passed "
"with :data:`TS_NET_EVENT_ACCEPT` is an :type:`TSVConn` just as it would be "
"for a normal accept. The plugin must act as if it is an HTTP server and "
"read the HTTP request and body from the :type:`TSVConn` and send an HTTP "
"response header and body."

":func:`TSHttpTxnServerIntercept` must be not be called after the connection "
"to the server has taken place. This means that the last hook last hook that "
"it can be called from is :data:`TS_HTTP_READ_CACHE_HDR_HOOK`. If a "
"connection to the server is not necessary, the continuation :arg:`contp` "
"will be sent a :data:`TS_EVENT_NET_ACCEPT_FAILED` event when the "
"transaction completes."

"The response from the plugin is cached subject to standard and configured "
"HTTP caching rules. Should the plugin wish the response not be cached, the "
"plugin must use appropriate HTTP response headers to prevent caching. The "
"primary purpose of :func:`TSHttpTxnServerIntercept` is allow plugins to "
"provide gateways to other protocols or to allow to plugin to it's own "
"transport for the next hop to the server. :func:`TSHttpTxnServerIntercept` "
"overrides parent cache configuration."
